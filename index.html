                Hello, I'm Yttrrium! Nice to meet you!
                I am a junior-level programmer trying new things in order to gather as much experience as I can. So hit me up with ideas, I'm open to everything.
                I started off with HTML, not a programming language, but it gave me a hint on what I would want to do on long-term. Mainly, I learn C++, but I 
                have been starting to explore other languages, such as Python, C#, Javascript and C along with methods of implementing GUI's into what I do.
                Below I will post a news log on what I do and learn, so check it out from time to time. <br><br><br>
                
            </p>
