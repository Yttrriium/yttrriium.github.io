                a desktop application. For more information about the project and all the difficulties met on the road check <a target="_blank" class= "a" href = "https://github.com/Yttrriium/Basic-Projects"> github</a>.
                A brief description of the app<br> would be by explaining what it does, basically reminds you to drink water once every half a hour, first alarm being right on start.<br>
                For the app click the next link: <a href = "https://github.com/Yttrriium/Basic-Projects/blob/main/DrinkWater.exe" class = "a" target="_blank" >Download</a><br>
                For the site version click the next link: <a href="dw.html" class = "a" target="_blank">Drink Water</a>
